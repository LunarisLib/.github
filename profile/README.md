# Lunaris

*Welcome to Lunaris organization! ðŸŽ‰*

*Lunaris is a project created by [Lohk](https://www.github.com/Lohkdesgds) originally and became a standard to his projects. Common C++ code and possibly public templates are made available here so anyone needing any of those tools can just download and use yourself! There are several repositories useful to many applications, like simple **encryption using RSA**, **multi-key map**, **sockets** and so on. All of them should work with both Windows and Linux.*

*The only thing we ask (if you're adding one or many libraries on your project) is a reference to this [organization page](https://www.github.com/LunarisLib) and, like in a game or movie, add our name somewhere so people interested can find us and maybe help improve the code. If your project doesn't have a screen or a way to show this, no problem. You can also add a link to **your project** on the official [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/eQfnXdTH6f). We would love to know what great things you're doing with it!*

*If you have any ideas to be added, changed or removed, please talk about it on our official [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/eQfnXdTH6f). This server has other projects in it too, so make sure to open the Lunaris category and talk there.*

*And what if you're interested on joining the team? Just join the Discord Server, we'll talk about it there ;P*
